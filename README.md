# Workout Tools
I started working out as a way to stay physically healthy during the pandemic, and I wanted to add a little bit of change to the generic audio that an iPhone plays when a timer ends. This experience inspired me to create this program that comes with stopwatch, timer with a music, and memo functionalities.

## Stopwatch
Stopwatch comes with start, stop, and reset buttons

## Timer
The user can set a timer and choose a **music** to play when the time is up
